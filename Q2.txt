=> Objects in JavaScript are data containers. 

=> They are made up of key-value pairs, with the key being a unique identifier (property) and the value being any data type.

Dot notation or bracket notation can be used to access and modify properties.

=> Objects can also have methods, which are associated functions.

=> Methods can use the properties of an object to perform actions or calculations.

=> JavaScript objects offer various methods to structure and manipulate data.

=> They are a basic data type in JavaScript and are commonly used in programming.
