Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1:-


    => It works in text format.

    => There is aÂ head of line blocking, which blocks all requests behind it until it does not receives all of its resources.

    => It uses the requested resource. Inlining for use with multiple pages

    => It compresses data automatically.

HTTP 2:- 

    => It operates on the binary protocol.

    => It supports multiplexing, requiring only one TCP connection to handle multiple requests.

    => It employs a PUSH frame by the server, which collects all multiple pages. 

    => It compresses data using HPACK.
